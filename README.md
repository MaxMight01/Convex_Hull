# Convex Hull
This repository showcases convex hull algorithms and provides basic functionality for adding and removing points in a 2D plane. The convex hull is the smallest convex polygon that can contain all the points in a given set.

## Features
- Implementations of convex hull algorithms.
- Dynamic addition and removal of points.

## Note
This repository is intended for demonstration purposes only. External contributions are not excepted except in rare cases.
